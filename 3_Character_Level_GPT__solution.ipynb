    "Note that tokenization is a trade-off between vocabulary size and sequence length: Large vocabularies will lead to shorter encoding sequences and vice versa. For example, encoding each character results in a short vocabulary of 26 tokens for the standard alphabet plus some more for special characters, but each word consists of longer encodings. On the other hand, encoding on word level means each word is encoded as a single token, but the vocabulary will be much larger (up to a whole dictionary of hundreds of thousands of words for one language). In practice, for example in ChatGPT, **sub word encodings** are used, which means not encoding entire words, but also not encoding individual characters. Instead, some intermediate format is used, for example the word 'undefined' could be encoded as three tokens: 'un', 'define', 'd'."

After `block_size`, we have to start truncating because the Transformer will never receive more than block size inputs when it's predicting the next character.\n",

Then it calculates a cross entropy loss using the labels. The `generate()` function applies softmax to the logits to get class probabilities, then samples the next character from a multinomial distribution based on these probabilities."

This will lead to a weighted average of the tokens (some tokens are more important than others to understand the text) instead of simply using the mean. And here is the idea: Every single token will emit two vectors: A **query** (\"What am I looking for?\") and a **key** (\"What do I contain?\"). The query then dot-products with all the keys to determine the similarity = affinity (stored in `wei`). Instead of the raw input `x`, which is private, a **value** is used (\"What will I communicate?\")."

All tokens then emit keys, and maybe a consonant at position 4 will emit a key with high number in this channel, meaning \"I am a consonant at position 4\". The 8th token will therefore have a high weight for the 4th token (0.2297), resulting in a high affinity (dot product) - the 4th and 8th token \"have found each other\". Through the softmax function, a lot of information from the 4th token will be passed to the 8th token (meaning the 8th token will learn a lot from the 4th)."

    "### Some Notes on Attention\n",
    "- Attention is a **communication mechanism**. It can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights. Here we have `block_size = 8` nodes, where the first node is only pointed to by itself, the second by the first and itself, and so on. Attention can be applied to any directed graph, not only language modeling.\n",
    "- Each example across batch dimension is processed completely independently, the examples never \"talk\" to each other across different batches. The batched matrix multiplication above means applying matrix multiplication in parallel in each batch separately. For example here, you can think of 4 different graphs in parallel with 8 noded each, where the 8 nodes only communicate among each other, even though we process 32 nodes at once.\n",
    "- \"Scaled\" attention also divides `wei` by `1/sqrt(head_size)`, in the original paper:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "   Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, `wei` will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Without the normalization, using Gaussian input (zero mean and variance 1), the weights will be in the order of `head_size`. Illustration below:"

If we have rather big or small weights, the softmax will converge towards one-hot vectors, which means that we only use one input node and discard all others. This is not what we want, especially in the beginning when the network is untrained. So the variance should remain around 1 especially at initialization, meaning the weights should be fairly diffuse.

    "\n",
    "We will make one change on the token encoding: Previously, the `token_embedding_table` was of size `(vocab_size, vocab_size)`, which means we directly plucked out the logits from the embedding table. Now we want to introduce an intermediate layer (make the net bigger). Therefore, we introduce a new parameter `n_embd` for the number of embedding dimensions, for example we can choose 32 or 64 for this intermediate representation. So instead of logits, the `token_embedding_table` will give us **token embeddings**. These will be fed to a linear layer afterwards to get the logits:\n",
    "```\n",
    "self.lm_head = nn.Linear(n_embd, vocab_size) # linear layer to decode into the vocabulary   \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the attention mechanism derived so far, there is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. Remember that we can think of attention as a directed graph, where the nodes have no idea where they are positioned in a space. But space matters in text: For example, \"people love animals\" has a significantly different meaning than \"animals love people\", so the ordering of the words is very important. This is why we need to **positionally encode** tokens:\n",
    "So far, we have only encoded each token according to its identity `idx`. But we now also encode its position in a second embedding table: Each position from `0` to `block_size-1` will get its own embedding vector. This is the code snippet from the init function that we will implement below: \n",
    "```\n",
    "        self.token_embedding_table = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, n_embd) # token embedding according to identity (e.g., first character in vocabulary)\n",
    "        self.position_embedding_table = nn.Embedding(block_size, n_embd) # positional encoding according to position in text (e.g., first character in text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "And here is a code snippet from the forward function, showing how integers from 0 to `block_size` are positionally encoded: \n",
    "```\n",
    "        B, T = idx.shape\n",
    "        # idx and targets are both (B,T) tensor of integers\n",
    "        tok_emb = self.token_embedding_table(idx) # (B,T,C)\n",
    "        pos_emb = self.position_embedding_table(torch.arange(T, device=device)) # (T,C) - integers from 0 to T-1\n",
    "        x = tok_emb + pos_emb # (B,T,C) via broadcasting (pos_emb gets right-aligned, new dimension of 1 gets added, broadcasted across batch)\n",
    "        logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B,T,vocab_size)\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we add **multi-head attention**, which is simply several attention heads running in parallel, then concatenating the result over the channel dimension. A **projection layer** combines the concatenated outputs from all heads into a single unified representation and projects back to the original pathway. Note that \"projection\" in the context of Transformer models refers to a linear transformation that can either maintain, reduce, or even increase the dimensionality of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitive Explanation: It helps to have multiple communication channels because these tokens have a lot to talk about - they want to find the consonants, the vowels, the vowels just from certain positions etc. and so it helps to create multiple independent channels of communication to gather lots of different types of data and then decode the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"multi-head-attention.jpg\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer Block\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we directly calculated the logits after the attention block, but this was way too fast - intuitively \"the tokens looked at each other, but didn't really have time to think on what they found from the other tokens\". Therefore, we add a feedforward single layer followed by a ReLU nonlinearity. Both layers together are called the **Transformer Block**, where we combine **communication** (self-attention) with **computation** (feedforward layer). This is on a per token level: Each token independently looks at the other tokens, and once it has gathered all the data, it thinks on that data individually. We implement this in the `Block` class below. The transformer block gets repeated over and over again.\n",

    "### Skip Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the transformer architecture above contains **skip connections (residual connections)**: The network contains parallel paths (one with some computations, one with the identity as \"shortcut\") that are combined via additions. Additions are great for backpropagation because they distribute gradients equally to both branches, so there is a \"shortcut\" for the gradients to directly propagate from the output to the input of the network. This avoids the vanishing gradient problem especially in the beginning - the transformer blocks only get more influence over time.\n",

(A fun advanced suggestion if you like: train a GPT to do addition of two numbers, i.e. a+b=c. You may find it helpful to predict the digits of c in reverse order, as the typical addition algorithm (that you're hoping it learns) would proceed right to left too. You may want to modify the data loader to simply serve random problems and skip the generation of train.bin, val.bin. You may want to mask out the loss at the input positions of a+b that just specify the problem using y=-1 in the targets (see CrossEntropyLoss ignore_index). Does your Transformer learn to add? Once you have this, swole doge project: build a calculator clone in GPT, for all of +-*/. Not an easy problem. You may need Chain of Thought traces.)\n",

Can you obtain a lower validation loss by the use of pretraining?\n",

For example, in sentiment analysis, we look at a whole sentence at once, then predict the sentiment \"happy\" or \"sad\" of the speaker. This can be realized using an **encoder** attention block. To implement an encoder attention block, we can simply delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. Attention does not care whether tokens from the future contribute or not, it supports arbitrary connectivity between nodes.\n",

For example, when translating from French to English, we condition the decoding on the past decoding *and* the fully encoded french prompt. "
